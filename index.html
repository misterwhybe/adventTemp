    <p>Welcome to the advent calender of Web 3. <br>
        Here we will see how much you learned the last months. <br>
        Every day, at 5pm UTC, a new task will be released. <br>
        You have 24h, and then the task is closed. <br>
        Finish this ASAP, every second counts. <br>
        The person with the most points after the last task closed wins. <br>
        The tasks start simple, and will get more difficult every day. <br>
        GL and enjoy.<br>
    </p>
